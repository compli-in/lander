If you've ever sold software to an enterprise customer, you know the drill: just when you think the deal is about to close, the security team sends over a 300-question spreadsheet. Welcome to the world of security questionnaires.

## What Are Security Questionnaires?

Security questionnaires are standardized forms that organizations use to assess the security posture of their vendors. They typically cover:

- **Access controls** - How do you manage user authentication?
- **Data encryption** - What encryption standards do you use?
- **Incident response** - What happens when something goes wrong?
- **Compliance certifications** - Are you SOC 2 certified? ISO 27001?
- **Business continuity** - What's your disaster recovery plan?

## Common Questionnaire Formats

### SIG (Standardized Information Gathering)

The SIG questionnaire, maintained by Shared Assessments, is one of the most comprehensive formats with over 800 questions in its full version.

### CAIQ (Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire)

Created by the Cloud Security Alliance, CAIQ focuses specifically on cloud security with around 300 questions.

### Custom Questionnaires

Many large enterprises create their own questionnaires, often combining elements from multiple standards.

## Tips for Efficient Responses

### 1. Build a Knowledge Base

Create a central repository of your security documentation and standard answers. This becomes your single source of truth.

### 2. Keep Answers Updated

Security practices evolve. Review and update your standard answers quarterly.

### 3. Be Honest

Never exaggerate your security capabilities. Misrepresentation can lead to contract termination and reputation damage.

### 4. Provide Evidence

Whenever possible, attach supporting documentation: policies, certifications, audit reports.

### 5. Use AI Assistance

Modern AI tools can help match questions to your existing answers and suggest responses based on your security documentation.
